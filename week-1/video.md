# Week 1 - video

MIT's Introduction to Computer Science and Programming [Introduction and Goals; Data Types, Operators, and Variables](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-00-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-fall-2008/video-lectures/lecture-1/)

- first part is just course administrative stuff, skip to 17min
- topics covered: abstract flow of stored instructions in a computer's memory, Turing's 6 primitives, data types

# Notes

[Turing 6's primitives](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28148562/what-are-the-six-basic-primitives-in-turing-complete):

- Right: Move the Machine’s head to the right of the current square
- Left: Move the Machine’s head to the left of the current square
- Print: Print a symbol on the current square
- Scan: Identify any symbols on the current square
- Erase: Erase any symbols presented o the current square
- Nothing/HALT: Do nothing

The idea is that with those six primitives you can program anything.
