# Course Objectives

- Anyone wanting an introduction or refresher of introductory computer science topics (e.g. data structures, computer architecture, functional programming, algorithms)

- Specifically, developers who haven't receive (or finished) formal education in Computer Science...e.g. bootcamp grads or self-taught

- Each week we will either watch a video or work through an exercise

- Basic introduction to several computer science topics - not necessarily in contiguous order

- Supplementary resources will be suggested for those who want to dive further into each week's topic

- Workshops are informal, so raise questions as we work through the material
